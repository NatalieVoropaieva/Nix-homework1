        <h1>Ken (Elton) Kesey</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>September 17, 1935, La Junta, Colorado - November 10, 2001, Eugene, Oregon) is an American novelist. Kesey was born in La Junta, and spent his childhood in the town Eugene, in the state of Oregon. His father was successful in the dairy business, founding the Eugene Farmers Corporation. Kesey's childhood and youth were spent fishing, hunting, swimming, boxing, wrestling and American football. Kesey studied at the University of Oregon, played in the student theater. In his last year, he received a scholarship to Stanford University, but soon he dropped out and joined the counterculture movement. In 1956, he married Faye Haxby, whom he had loved since school years. Wrote the novel "Zivorynets" ("Zoo"), which was not published. It is dedicated to the beat community of the North Coast (San Francisco), to which K. himself belonged, their travels around the country and their lifestyle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a student, Kesey participated in experiments on the use of powerful drugs for the treatment of mental disorders. After the intervention of the authorities, this dangerous scientific program was closed, but Kesey worked for six months as an orderly and night watchman at the Menlow Park, California, hospital for war veterans, where the program was conducted. He voluntarily took drugs there and reported on the consequences. These experiments in a psychiatric hospital, as well as participation in "LSD sessions" formed the background of Kesey's most famous novel. "One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest" ("One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest", 1962). The writer himself noted that he recreated "real people and real situations" in it. While working on the book, K. used one of the hallucinogens, peyote.</p>

        <h2>"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A tragic parable about a rebellion against the contempt for human dignity in a psychiatric hospital, which is undoubtedly a metaphor for the entire American society. Keyes exposes the social system, which suppresses everything "atypical" and independent in the name of average well-being. The title of the work is a line from a children's song, remembered by the narrator Brom Bromden nicknamed "Chief", a half-Indian giant who pretends to be deaf and mute. It was his image that Kesey considered his greatest artistic achievement. Bromden is a schizophrenic, and in his perception, reality and delusion sometimes merge, then double. That is why variability and ambiguity are organic in the structure of this work. In the clinic are not only absolutely sick ("plants"), but also vulnerable and non-standard people. The only refuge for their tortured memory is a hallucination, so they seek refuge within the walls of the hospital. An iron order reigns in the hospital, and its constant patron is Elder Sister Ratchet. Into the world of the clinic and the world of the narrator enters the petty criminal, anarchist and merrymaker Randall Patrick McMurphy, who is trying to change the bureaucratic system of the hospital. In the Chief's sick mind, the conflict between Sister Ratchet and McMurphy turns into a battle between good and evil. McMurphy becomes a victim of a repressive system. He plans to escape, but after a wild party, doctors perform a lobotomy on him. Bromden suffocates him with a pillow and flees to Canada.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Society and the order created by it - the "system", the state, the "harvester" are, in Kesey's opinion, the main enemy of modern man. K. is convinced of the incompleteness of the human personality, moreover, of the uncertainty, randomness, and chaos of human history. Kizi's novel, as noted by T. Denisova, "helps to understand the essence of "black humor" â€” in particular, his ability to ridicule himself and evaluate society as something hostile to the individual. The world and man are depicted as having lost their meaning. And therefore harmony, or even itself the possibility of human communication, become the privilege of madmen".</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Broadway theater season of 1963-1964 pp. a production based on the novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" appeared (staged by D. Wasserman). More than 80 performances were performed at the Court Theater (with Kirk Douglas as McMurphy). In 1975, M. Forman made a film based on Kesey's novel, which became a cult (it won five "Oscars"). The role of McMurphy was brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson. However, Kesey himself was dissatisfied with the film, accused the filmmakers of distorting the idea and even filed a lawsuit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kesey's next novel - "Sometimes a Great Notion" ("Sometimes a Great Notion", 1964) was not successful. The novel takes place in a logging crew and revolves around the relationship of two brothers, Hank Stamper and Draeger, their violent family feud. Motifs, familiar from Kesey's first novel, are depicted against the background of a provincial town threatened with ecological disaster. The book was adapted into a screenplay in 1971 (director and performer of the main role - Paul Newman).</p>
        <br>
        <p>After working on the novel, Kesey retired from literary activity for a long time. He organized the "Merrie Pranksters" group, settled with a hippie commune in La Honda, California, traveled with friends to America and Mexico. In 1965 p. Keysey was arrested for illegal possession of drugs. He fled to Mexico, but in 1967 he was found and sent to the United States, where he is in the San Mateo County Jail.He served a five-month term in jail. After this tumultuous period, Kesey farmed, raised four children, and ran a writing workshop at the University of Oregon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the 70s pp. Kesey returned to literature, published the books Kesey's Garage Sale (1973), Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier (1974-1979), Demon Box ", 1986). His later works include the children's book "Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear" ("Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear", 1990), "The Further Inquiry", 1990, together with P. Bevirt, " Caves" ("Caverns", 1990; under the pseudonym O. Yu. Levon), "Sea Lion" ("The Sea Lion, 1991"). "Sailor Song" ("Sailor Song", 1992) is a futuristic novel about an Alaskan fishing village and a Hollywood film crew. Kesey's last book - "Last go Around" ("Last go Around", 1994, together with K. Babbs) is dedicated to the famous Oregon rodeo and is written in the style of mass literature ("pulp fiction"). Kesey died due to complications after surgery for liver cancer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a writer, Kesey is primarily associated with the novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"; as a cultural figure, he is a symbol of the American post-war counterculture, a "guru" of psychedelic drugs, a figure who connects the "broken generation" of the 50s with the hippie movement of the 60s.</p>
